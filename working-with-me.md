## Working with Me (aka. AHA, aka. *A*mir *H*. *A*bdi, aka. Amir)

In the Big Bang Theory series (S01E16) Howard jokes about 
["Sheldon coming with a manual"](https://youtu.be/n8ghizM7Dto?t=118). 
Well... I'm, optimistically, more socially skilled. Haha...
The following is my professional manual, which, over time, gets updated
as I release newer versions of myself (i.e., get old), and discover new features and bugs! 

***Note**: I'm not a native anglophone; yet, I try hard to remain funny and entertaining in English! 
The above joke is as such.*

### Feedback
TL;DR: I'm obsessed with constructive feedback, and more on what I can improve.
- I like direct uncensored feedback. If I failed to personally ask for feedback, please initiate 
  the conversation.
- If you observed something you liked, please let me know so that I can continue the pattern. But, 
  in a feedback session, I care mainly about the areas I should *improve*.    
  Simply put, I anticipate 80% of the feedback session to be centered around improvements. 
- I like the [SBI  (Situaion/Behaviour/Impact)](https://youtu.be/-oRKr5xA9N0) 
  framework when giving/receiving feedback. 
- Not surprisingly, I'm more comfortable receiving feedback than giving it.

### Communication
TL;DR: I document everything and prefer written communication. 
- I prefer asynchronous (written) communication.
- As an Engineer, I script things to avoid repeating myself;
  similarly, as a team-player, I document everything to avoid repeated arguments.
- During meetings, I tend to take live notes and add action items to keep track of the flow. 
  I might not ask you to take notes, but, if you volunteered, I'll take you on the offer. 
- As an individual contributor, I write [15-5 weekly reports](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/15-5/).
- As a manager, I appreciate those who write [15-5 weekly reports](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/15-5/).
- I ask lots of questions. I'm not questioning you, but, merely trying to learn.
  I try hard to maintain a positive and pleasant tone when asking 
  questions; yet, if I came too strong on my comments and made you feel uncomfortable, please give me some [feedback](#feedback).

### Pace
I love it when things move fast, from decision-making to execution (who doesn't?). 
At the same time, I need to be reminded to adjust my expectations of the pace to avoid both 
frustration and burnout.

### Learning Style
- I learn best via hands-on experience.
- If the concept is complex, or I'm missing some requirements, I need time to process it and come
  back to you after.
- I prefer to learn at my own pace via book/paper/blog/video. Share a reference/tutorial that you
  liked, and I'll be in your debt.
  
### Working Style
- I can't think fast right on-the-spot. I need time to analyze a problem for a reliable answer.
- Some sense of urgency elevates my efficiency. Not suggesting you to create fake urgencies, but, 
  "Pressure is a Privilege" (Billie Jean King).
